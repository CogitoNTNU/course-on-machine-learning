# Course on Machine Learning 
In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of machine learning through practical experience with the Titanic dataset. By the end of the session, you will be able to:
* Understand the basic concepts of machine learning.
* Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data.
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
* Collaborate with a team to solve machine learning problems.


## Prerequisites
* Ensure that git is installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CogitoNTNU/course-on-machine-learning.git
```
2. Install juptyer notebook
```bash
pip install ipykernel -U --user
```
3. Team leads should join Kaggle and create a team. [Join Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/67df65cd5c6448d8845bde6666511def)
