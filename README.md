# Course on Machine Learning 
In this hands-on workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of machine learning through practical experience with the Titanic dataset. By the end of the session, you will be able to:
* Understand the basic concepts of machine learning.
* Apply machine learning algorithms to real-world data.
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.
* Collaborate with a team to solve machine learning problems.


## Prerequisites
* Ensure that git is installed on your machine. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended) [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Familiarity with Jupyter Notebooks.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CogitoNTNU/course-on-machine-learning.git
```
2. Install juptyer notebook
```bash
pip install ipykernel -U --user
```
3. Team leads should join Kaggle and create a team. [Join Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/t/67df65cd5c6448d8845bde6666511def)

## How to Use This Notebook
Follow the parts in order, completing tasks and exercises as you go.
Experiment with the code cells to reinforce your learning.
Refer to the "Extras" section for additional tools and techniques beyond the course scope.
Happy learning!
